    training you are after and provide excellent advice on getting your commercial license after completing your PPL, or exciting adventures to undertake simply with your Private Pilots License.

    instructional.</br>

    with flying.</br>

    <br>The rest of our instructors (with thousands and thousands of hours experience between them) in both civilian and military aviation backgrounds include seven Full-time instructors and eight Part-time instructors.
    </br>
    <br>Tamsyn Illman works as the Operations & Marketing Manager as well as the organiser of various events and fly-outs.
    </br>

    </br>
    <br>Aerobatic training can be undertaken in the Cessna Aerobat 150.
    </br>
    <br>Flight Training London at London Elstree Aerodrome provides an exciting base to conduct your training with Ikaron Café on-site as well as a Pooley’s Aviation Shop and an array of large and visiting aircraft, not to mention the frequent film
    shooting or celebrity appearance being so close to Warner Bros and Elstree Film studios. It also has 24 hour access to people with PPL’s given the runway lights.
    </br>
    <br>With our good social atmosphere and loads of different events being held throughout the year, Flight Training London also provides a place to meet like-minded people as well as an environment to start networking within the aviation industry.

    <br>It has also proven a popular site for visiting aviators from all over the world to hire aircraft with an instructor and see what it is like to fly in one of the busiest but scenic airspaces in the world with the skyline of London viewable
    from the plane. Visitors can benefit from learning how to navigate safely in the airspace between 4 of the 5 major airports near London including Heathrow Airport.
    </br>
    <br>If you have the aviation bug or you want to give yourself (or a close one) the gift of flight, come for one of our trial lessons where you (after a thorough briefing) will get behind the controls of one of our dual control training aircraft
    with one of our experienced instructors.
    </br>
    <br>We are open 7 days a week. Our office hours are 9am-5pm but contactable by phone from 8am - 8pm everyday.
